This is the source code I've used in multiple talks, as well as
the [Tekpub Async series](http://tekpub.com/products/async) and the
third edition of [C# in Depth](http://csharpindepth.com).

Still to come: notes to make sense of the code! These won't be nearly
as detailed as the talks, screencasts or book, but they should at
least give a reasonable starting point.
