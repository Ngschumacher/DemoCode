Why aren't we good at this?
- Sometimes (local) mutability is just easier
- Language encourages mutability with things like object/collection initializers
  - Few features designed with immutability in mind
  - Static analysis of immutability would require language/library/runtime support
- Lack of framework support is discouraging (immutable collections)
- Serialization frameworks often don't support immutability well
  - IXmlSerializable, I'm looking at you...
- Even immutable structs aren't really - lack of atomicity is a pain
