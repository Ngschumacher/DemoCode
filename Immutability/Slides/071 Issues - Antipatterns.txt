Naming:
- IReadOnlyCollection<T> isn't

Freezing:
- Feels good, but introduces complexity: reasoning is hard

Mutable/immutable variants:
- Joda Time type hierarchy (simplified):

               ReadableInstant
			 /                 \
        Instant             MutableInstant
- What do you accept as a method parameter? What do you return?
