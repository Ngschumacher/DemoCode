- Can end up with pretty unreadable client code
- Can end up creating a lot of objects
- Half as many types!
- Constructors can use optional parameters to avoid being too hairy
- Potentially need to have With methods with multiple parameters
  if they are constrained with respect to each other
- Not a common paradigm at the moment
- Constructors can be an ugly way of initializing, unless you use
  named arguments (name those parameters clearly!)
- If you're autogenerating: consider the constructor parameter order...
