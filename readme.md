This repository is a general space for bits and bobs that I (Jon
Skeet) use in public appearances.

It will include sample code from talks, slides, and potentially
code used in blog posts.

Each top-level directory generally represents a post or a talk;
subdirectories will specify Code, Slides, Notes etc if appropriate.

All code is released under the Apache License 2.0, as found in the
LICENSE.txt file. I'll attempt to remember to include that in a
copyright comment at the top of each file, but if I forget, that's
what it *should* be...
